## CppDepend - Static Analysis Tool

CppDepend is a sophisticated static analysis tool for C/C++ codebases, available on both Windows and Linux platforms. It is designed to improve code quality and maintainability with features like code quality metrics, codebase visualization, dependency analysis, trend monitoring, and CI/CD integration. More information about CppDepend can be found on their [official website](https://www.cppdepend.com/).

### Key Features of CppDepend

#### 1. Coding Standards
CppDepend's adherence to coding standards such as MISRA C, MISRA C++, CERT C, CERT C++, CWE, and AUTOSAR is pivotal for ensuring code safety and reliability. These standards are particularly crucial in safety-critical industries like automotive and aerospace, providing guidelines that mitigate risks and enhance code security.
